# Assignment Instruction
For all USA Airports, Develop an API and module where we can get current conditions for the airport 
asked by the API and we can get current weather graphs (for example, the temperature for the last 24 hours) for specific period.  
It does not have to be graphs but the data needed.

# Introduction to the Airport Weather API
This is the API for users that want to check the weather condition for interested places.

The weather information is based on openweathermap.org The application is based on location ID of file "histort.city.list.json" that offered by the OpenWeather official.

For different methods to trace the exact location. You should go to the website https://openweathermap.org/current for detailed information.

Go to https://openweathermap.org/city, sign up and get an API key, and paste the key into the file airportweather.py

Run this file on the command window.
